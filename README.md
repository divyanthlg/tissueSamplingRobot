# tissueSamplingRobot
This repository contains the ROS package (motor_control), code, machine vision models, image dataset (potato_image_dataset.zip), and CAD files for our research on developing a robotic system for efficient and precise tissue sample extraction from dormant potato tubers, intended for molecular-based pathogen detection.
